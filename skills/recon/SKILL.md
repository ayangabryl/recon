name: recon
description: Recon any URL into a buildable design blueprint — faithful clone or original remix. Captures browser screenshots, CDP tokens, spacing/motion/responsive audits, RESEARCH.md, and DESIGN.md. Modes mirror (pixel-faithful), remix (same vibe, your product), scout (research only). Triggers on "recon", "recon this site", "clone this site", "remix this design", "same vibe my copy", "research this URL", "DESIGN.md from URL", "match this design", "build from reference". Requires a real browser — not curl.

# Recon

Recon a live site into a screenshot-backed blueprint — then **mirror** it faithfully, **remix** it into something original, or **scout** and stop at docs.

Record the active mode at the top of `RESEARCH.md`: `mode: mirror | remix | scout`

**Do not** rely on `curl` HTML alone. Use a **real browser** — see [agents.md](./agents.md) for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and Playwright fallback.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add ayangabryl/recon --skill recon
```

## Screenshot policy (default)

| User provides | Agent must use |
|---------------|----------------|
| **URL only** (no attached images) | **Agent browser screenshots** — mandatory |
| URL + attached reference images | User images + agent screenshots (agent fills gaps) |
| Existing `docs/research/{slug}/screenshots/` | Those files; re-capture only if stale or user asks |

When the user sends **no reference screenshot**, the agent is the photographer:

1. Navigate → reference URL
2. Screenshot → full page + one shot per major section
3. Copy PNGs into `docs/research/{slug}/screenshots/` on disk
4. **Gate:** do not write `DESIGN.md` or application code until ≥1 full-page + ≥3 section screenshots exist

Do **not** substitute: memory, HTML scrape, `curl`, or prose descriptions. Screenshots capture dashed rulers, icon rows, shadows.

**No browser MCP?** Run [scripts/capture.mjs](./scripts/capture.mjs) (Playwright), then continue with CDP scripts from [reference.md](./reference.md).

After build (**mirror** mode): navigate to localhost → compare to reference. **Remix** mode: taste-check against your goals, not pixel diff.

## Fidelity modes (pick on first prompt)

Ask if the user did not say. They can invoke explicitly:

> Recon **remix** https://wise.design — same carousel vibe, my SaaS brand

| Mode | User intent | Research | Build | Step 7 compare |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| **scout** | Learn the site | Full pipeline | **No code** | Skip |
| **mirror** | Faithful clone / match | Full pipeline | Match reference layout + chrome | **Required** — must pass |
| **remix** | Original product, reference **language** | Full + creative direction | Your copy, brand, assets | **Optional** — soft check only |

### scout

- Output `docs/research/{slug}/` only (`RESEARCH.md`, `DESIGN.md`, screenshots, audits)
- Do not write application code unless the user asks in a follow-up
- Default when user says "research", "audit", "what makes this site tick"

### mirror

- Treat reference screenshots as **ground truth**
- Run `compare.mjs` + `compare-responsive.mjs` when `gates.axisDiffers`
- Run `behavior-test.mjs` when interactions exist
- Ship only when compares pass (or user documents accepted gaps in `RESEARCH.md`)
- Default when user says "clone", "match", "one-shot", "same as"

### remix

- Extract **design language**: rhythm, type scale, motion patterns, IA, responsive behavior
- `RESEARCH.md` must include **Creative direction** — what to keep vs reinvent (see [reference.md](./reference.md))
- `DESIGN.md` must include **Substitutions** — your colors, fonts, copy, imagery; never pass off scraped logos as yours
- Implement **patterns** (marquee, hover expand, intro choreography) not **brand** (their logo, Docs link, proprietary copy)
- Step 7 compare scripts: **do not block** on `pass: false` — use for inspiration QA only
- Default when user says "same vibe", "inspired by", "like X but for my app", "original"

**Both remix and mirror** use the same research steps (responsive, intro, behaviors). Only build fidelity and verify gates change.

## Quick start

1. **Pick mode** → scout | mirror | remix (ask if unclear; default **scout** if only URL given)
2. Run research workflow → `docs/research/{slug}/`
3. If mirror or remix + user wants build → implement from `DESIGN.md`

## Output layout

```
docs/research/{slug}/
├── RESEARCH.md     # verdict, stack, findings, clone strategy
├── DESIGN.md       # single build contract: colors, type, spacing, motion, components
├── responsive.json # optional symlink — lives in screenshots/responsive/
├── responsive.md
└── screenshots/
    ├── 00-hero-full.png …
    └── responsive/     # Step 3i — mobile-375, tablet-800, desktop-1920
        ├── responsive.json
        ├── responsive.md
        └── *-viewport.png
```

**`DESIGN.md` is the only file agents need to build.** Spacing and motion are sections inside it — not separate files.

**Slug:** hostname without `www` (e.g. `vocorize.com` → `vocorize`).

## Research workflow

```
- [ ] Navigate to URL (see agents.md)
- [ ] Full-page screenshot
- [ ] Section viewport screenshots
- [ ] **Responsive audit — mobile + tablet + desktop (Step 3i)**
- [ ] Extract tokens via CDP / Runtime.evaluate
- [ ] Spacing audit (h1 positions, dividers, fixed rhythm)
- [ ] Motion audit (appear ids, keyframes, iframes, transitions)
- [ ] Detect non-CSS assets (Spline, video, Lottie)
- [ ] Map section IA
- [ ] Write RESEARCH.md + DESIGN.md
- [ ] Copy screenshots into workspace
```

### Step 1 — Open site

Use your agent's browser tool. Cursor: `browser_navigate` + `browser_lock`. Others: see [agents.md](./agents.md).

### Step 2 — Screenshots

1. **Full page:** `00-full-page.png` (`fullPage: true`)
2. **Sections:** scroll to each major `h1` / hero / footer → `01-hero.png`, `02-…`

Scroll via JS: `window.scrollTo(0, headingY - 120)`.

### Step 3i — Responsive / mobile design (required before build)

**Desktop-only research fails on Figma Sites and modern portfolios.** wise.design ships **two HTML breakpoint trees** (`data-breakpoint-id` 375 vs 800) — mobile is not “scaled desktop”.

| Desktop (1920) | Mobile (375) |
|----------------|--------------|
| Horizontal marquee | **Vertical** card stack |
| Inspiration/Direction toggle | **No toggle** |
| Cards 96–213 × 120px | Cards ~124px wide, **variable height** |
| Logo in header bar | Logo 40×40 at (16, 18) |

**Procedure:**

1. Run: `node skills/recon/scripts/responsive-audit.mjs <url> docs/research/{slug}/screenshots/responsive`
2. Read **`responsive.md`** first — know mobile vs desktop before writing code
3. Screenshot gate: need **mobile-375** + **desktop-1920** PNGs minimum
4. Record in `DESIGN.md` **Responsive** section:
   - Breakpoints (px) and what changes (axis, chrome, typography, hidden elements)
   - Figma `data-breakpoint` ids if present
   - Build approach: separate route/component vs CSS reflow vs `matchMedia`
5. Re-run intro/behavior audits **per viewport** when motion or interactions differ on mobile

**Detection in `responsive.json`:**

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `carousel.axis` | `horizontal` or `vertical` |
| `chrome.hasToggle` | Segmented control present |
| `figmaBreakpoints` | Which Figma tree is visible |
| `gates.axisDiffers` | **Must implement both layouts** |

**Build rule:** If `gates.axisDiffers: true`, do not clone desktop marquee only. Mobile gets its own layout spec from `responsive.md`. **After build, run `compare-responsive.mjs` — research screenshots alone do not verify the clone.**

**Playwright:** `node skills/recon/scripts/responsive-audit.mjs <url> <out-dir>`

### Step 3 — Token extraction (CDP)

Run `Runtime.evaluate` with `returnByValue: true`. Script: [reference.md](./reference.md).

Extract fonts, colors, type scale, layout widths, buttons, section map, iframes, motion hints, platform, icons (SVG/img vs emoji via `innerHTML`).

### Step 3b — Spacing audit

Measure via CDP → write **Spacing** section in `DESIGN.md`. Script: [reference.md](./reference.md).

**Rule:** Separate **fixed rhythm** (repeatable px) from **section gaps** (content-driven). Never guess `mt-[140px]`.

### Step 3c — Motion audit

Measure motion via CDP → write **Motion** section in `DESIGN.md`.

**Rule:** Only implement motion the audit finds.

Map each pattern to CSS snippets in [reference.md](./reference.md) (see `web/src/styles/transitions-dev.css` in this repo for working examples):

| UI pattern | Snippet class |
|------------|---------------|
| Text changes in place (rotating keyword, status) | **text-states-swap** (`.t-text-swap`) |
| Segmented control / filter pills / view toggle | **tabs-sliding** (`.t-tabs`) |
| Dropdown from trigger | **menu-dropdown** |
| Modal dialog | **modal** |
| Number updates | **number-pop-in** |
| Icon toggles | **icon-swap** |
| Stacked hero lines entering | **texts-reveal** |
| Loading / streaming label | **shimmer-text** |
| Hover hint bubble | **tooltip** |
| Marquee / carousel / GSAP timeline | Document in DESIGN.md; use GSAP or CSS animation |
| No clear match | Note in DESIGN.md; ask before guessing |

**Build procedure (when motion exists):**

1. Copy relevant tokens + snippet CSS into the project (from reference.md or `web/src/styles/transitions-dev.css`).
2. Paste CSS **verbatim** — do not collapse to `transition: all`.
3. Wire documented hooks (`.t-text-swap`, `.t-tabs`, `aria-selected`, …).
4. Add JS orchestration only when the pattern requires it.
5. **Keep every `prefers-reduced-motion` guard.**

### Step 3d — Motion choreography capture (timing)

**Screenshots alone cannot capture choreography.** When motion matters (marquees, GSAP timelines, scroll scenes), run a **time-series sample** before writing `DESIGN.md`.

**Motion type gate (required):** Before assuming auto-scroll, classify what the reference actually does:

| Type | How to verify | Do not assume from |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Auto marquee** | Element `x` changes over 3s with no input; pause/play stops it | Progress bar alone |
| **Drag / swipe** | Position changes only while pointer down / touch active | Horizontal layout |
| **Scroll-linked** | Transform tied to `scrollY` / ScrollTrigger | Full-width row of cards |
| **Static** | No transform change over 5s sample | Carousel-looking layout |

Sample twice: seconds 0–3 and 3–6 (discard first second if page is still settling). If delta ≈ 0 with no interaction → **not** auto-scroll.

**wise.design (verified):** CSS infinite marquee ~**60px/s** linear; `pause-carousel` stops it; progress thumb tracks position. Clone uses GSAP equivalent — correct behavior, wrong to guess before sampling.

**Three capture modes** (use all that apply):

| Mode | When | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **A. Transform sampling** | Any moving element (carousel, hero) | `motion-samples.json` — position every 200ms |
| **B. GSAP introspection** | `window.gsap` exists | Tween duration, ease, delay from live timelines |
| **C. CSS keyframe parse** | `@keyframes` in stylesheets | duration, easing, from/to values |

**Procedure:**

1. Identify the moving element (carousel img, hero track, pinned section).
2. Run the choreography script from [reference.md](./reference.md) via CDP (`awaitPromise: true`, ~5s sample).
3. Save result to `docs/research/{slug}/motion-samples.json`.
4. Optionally capture **burst screenshots** at 0s / 1s / 2s → `screenshots/motion-*.png` for visual diff.
5. Derive build tokens in `DESIGN.md` **Motion** section:

| Derived token | How |
|---------------|-----|
| `scroll-px-per-second` | `median(deltaX) / sampleIntervalMs * 1000` |
| `loop-duration` | `trackWidth / pxPerSecond` |
| `easing` | constant delta → `none` / linear; GSAP → copy `ease` string |
| `gsap-duration` | from introspection, not guessed |

**GSAP sites:** prefer Mode B — read `gsap.globalTimeline` children when accessible. If minified/bundled and Mode B fails, fall back to Mode A.

**Not GSAP:** wise.design uses CSS/JS transforms (~60px/s linear marquee). Do not assume GSAP — measure first.

**Playwright fallback:** `node skills/recon/scripts/motion-sample.mjs <url> <out.json>`

**Lenis detection:** `window.Lenis` / `window.lenis`, `[data-lenis-prevent]`, `html.lenis`. Record in `motion-samples.json` → `lenis: true|false`. Clone only if reference uses it.

Record choreography tokens in `DESIGN.md` — do not guess `duration: 50` without samples.

### Step 3h — Intro / page-load sequence (required on first paint)

**Most skills fail here:** `networkidle` waits until the intro is **already over**. A single screenshot captures the **end state only**. Sparse checkpoints (250ms → 1000ms → 3500ms) **skip the animation** — you see empty, then jump to final.

**wise.design intro (verified):** NOT GSAP, NOT Lenis. Figma React — **empty chrome → single centered card → full marquee** over ~3.5s. Opacity on DOM nodes stays `1`; detection must use **visible pixel area in viewport band**, not `opacity: 0` counts.

**Capture without screen recording** (AI cannot watch video — use a **dense flipbook**):

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `intro-sequence/frames/` | **Dense** burst PNGs — 33ms steps 0–1s, 50ms 1–2.5s, 100ms 2.5–5s (~70–90 frames) |
| `intro-sequence/keyframes/` | **Phase-change only** — empty → hero-focus → marquee-building → marquee-full |
| `intro-sequence/storyboard.md` | Ordered keyframes with descriptions — **read this first** |
| `intro-sequence/intro-sequence.json` | Per-ms: phase, visibleArea, spreadWidth, largestW |

**Procedure:**

1. Navigate with `waitUntil: 'commit'` — **not** `networkidle`
2. Run: `node skills/recon/scripts/intro-sequence.mjs <url> docs/research/{slug}/intro-sequence`
3. Read **`storyboard.md`** then **`keyframes/`** in time order — not 3 sparse PNGs
4. If gaps still too coarse, re-run without `--sparse` (default is dense)
5. Detect engine:

| Engine | Detection |
|--------|-----------|
| GSAP | `window.gsap` + `globalTimeline` children |
| Lenis | `window.Lenis`, `data-lenis-prevent` |
| CSS | `@keyframes` in stylesheets |
| React/Figma | phase: `hero-focus` → `marquee-full`, no global gsap |

6. Audit HTML for hidden duplicate views (`data-breakpoint`)
7. Write `DESIGN.md` **Intro** section from `storyboard.md` keyframes

**Intro detection gate (must pass):**
- `intro.type` ≠ `none`
- `keyframes.length` ≥ 2
- `phasesSeen` includes transition (e.g. `empty` → `hero-focus` → `marquee-full`)

**Build rule:** If `keyframes/` shows staged reveal, clone must implement intro — not mount final layout immediately.

### Step 3e — Interaction / behavior capture

**Static screenshots miss hover, focus, expand, pause, and drag behaviors.** After motion sampling, audit interactions before build.

**Procedure:**

1. List interactive elements from snapshot + CDP (`button`, `[data-asset-*]`, `aria-label`, toggles).
2. Run **behavior probe** — hover/focus each major control, record before/after:
   - dimensions, `data-*` state flags, opacity, child panels revealed
3. Save `docs/research/{slug}/behaviors.json`
4. Screenshot **each interaction state** → `screenshots/behavior-hover.png`, `behavior-focus.png`, etc.
5. Write `DESIGN.md` **Behaviors** section (required when interactions exist)

| Probe | How |
|-------|-----|
| Hover expand | `mouseenter` on carousel card → measure media `width/height/radius` |
| Pause on hover | Check CSS `:hover { animation-play-state }` or JS pause |
| Toggle / tab | Click → screenshot active vs inactive |
| Focus metadata | DOM nodes revealed on hover (title, description, tags) |
| **Hover layout tokens** | While hovered: measure title col width, desc font/color, tag placement — save `hover-layout.json` |
| Data attributes | `data-asset-title`, `data-asset-description`, `data-asset-active` |

**Hover layout gate:** A behavior screenshot is not enough. On active/hover state, CDP-measure:
- Title vs description **column widths** (wise.design: 80px title + flex desc — not 50/50 grid)
- Tag row **alignment** (under description column, not full width)
- Meta **offset** from expanded media (gap, horizontal padding)
- Typography per role (title **12px/600**, desc 12px/#666, tags 10px on **#f0f0f0** fill — not bordered)
- **Flex cross-axis:** `align-items: center`; active shell height grows, neighbors stay short — shared vertical center (measure card `y` + `height` for active vs inactive)
- **Expand origin:** media grows from center (`top: 50%`), not top-anchored

**Build rule:** Do not default to `grid-cols-2` for hover metadata without measuring column asymmetry. Do not wrap cards in extra divs that break flex alignment.

**CDP behavior script:** [reference.md](./reference.md) — `behaviorProbe()`

**Playwright:** `node skills/recon/scripts/behavior-audit.mjs <url> behaviors.json`

**Build rule:** If `behaviors.json` documents hover-expand, implement it (GSAP or CSS). Do not ship scroll-only when reference pauses/expands on hover.

### Step 3f — UI chrome capture (logo, icon buttons, progress)

**Screenshots miss exact chrome.** Extract measured specs for header/footer controls:

| Control | Capture |
|---------|---------|
| Logo | `img` src + mask SVG, container `width/height`, `border-radius`, padding |
| Icon buttons | `outerHTML` of `<svg>` per state (play vs pause) — do not guess bars/triangles |
| Progress bar | Track `width/height/bg`, thumb `width/bg`, scroll sync behavior |
| Toggle pill | Active/inactive text colors, pill bg, track bg |

Save `docs/research/{slug}/ui-chrome.json`. Record in `DESIGN.md` **Components** with exact px + colors.

**CDP:** extract `aria-label="pause-carousel"` SVG, `[aria-label="line"]` dimensions, logo link structure.

**Build rule:** Never substitute a generic bordered circle for a captured SVG button. Never use wrong logo asset (pattern PNG without mask = broken logo).

### Step 3g — Cycling micro-copy (footer rotators, tickers)

**Static text in screenshots lies.** Some labels animate or rotate languages.

**Detect:**
1. CDP: watch footer/header text for **3–8s** — collect all unique strings
2. Look for `.vertical-text-rotator`, `[class*="rotator"]`, `aria-live="polite"`, marquee text
3. Record `@keyframes` or JS interval timing
4. Save strings + interval in `behaviors.json` → `cyclingCopy`

**Build rule:** If reference cycles ≥2 attribution strings, clone must cycle the same lines (research use — paraphrase OK for proprietary sites, but **behavior** must match).

### Step 4 — Flag non-scrapeable assets

| Asset type | Action |
|------------|--------|
| Spline iframe | Record URL; embed or substitute |
| Video / Lottie | Record src; loop or poster |
| Framer/Webflow | Note builder; JS-hydrated layout |
| Brand logos / copy | Document pattern only — don't scrape literally |

### Step 5 — Write docs

Templates: [reference.md](./reference.md). **`DESIGN.md`** sections: Summary, Colors, Typography, Spacing, Motion, **Behaviors** (when interactions exist), Components, Build checklist.

### Step 6 — Release browser session

Unlock / close browser when multi-step capture is done.

### Step 7 — Compare to original (**mirror mode** — required before "done")

**Skip blocking compare in remix mode** (optional soft run). **Skip entirely in scout mode.**

**Static research is not enough — verify the mirror against the live reference.**

**Desktop compare:**
1. Run dev server for the clone route
2. `node skills/recon/scripts/compare.mjs <ref> <clone> docs/research/{slug}/compare`
3. Screenshot review at 1920×1080 — card density, toggle, footer, hover states

**Responsive compare (required when `responsive.json` → `gates.axisDiffers: true`):**
1. `node skills/recon/scripts/compare-responsive.mjs <ref> <clone> docs/research/{slug}/compare-responsive`
2. Must pass **both** mobile-375 and desktop-1920 checks
3. Review `reference-mobile-375.png` vs `clone-mobile-375.png` — **header chrome is not optional**

| Mobile gate | What must match |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `mobile-carousel-axis` | `vertical` on clone |
| `mobile-icon-toggle` | Globe + Direction icon buttons (40×40), not text toggle |
| `mobile-docs-link` | Docs pill → `docs.wise.design` |
| `mobile-logo-size` | 40×40 @ ~(16, 18) |

**Do not mark mobile "done" after desktop compare only.** Screenshotting mobile in Step 3i is research — Step 7 proves the clone matches.

5. Re-run compares after fixes — do not mark done on first pass if metrics fail

**Behavior regression test:** `node skills/recon/scripts/behavior-test.mjs <ref> <clone> <out.json>`

Tests: chrome sizes, hover expand, **footer text rotator** (≥2 strings), **rapid-hover stress** (no stuck expanded cards). Required when site has carousel or cycling copy.

**Playwright:** `compare.mjs` (desktop) + `compare-responsive.mjs` (mobile + desktop gates)

**Heuristic fail signals:**
| Delta | Likely bug |
|-------|------------|
| `visibleCards` clone ≪ reference | Cards reserve hover width when collapsed |
| `avgCardWidth` clone ≫ reference | Same — 480px shells in flex row |
| Toggle colors wrong | Inactive tab same color as track |
| Missing meta on hover | Step 3e behaviors not implemented |
| Footer text never changes | Step 3g cycling copy missed |
| Hover glitches when moving fast | No `killTweensOf` / single active card / rapid-hover test |

**Build rule (mirror):** Ship only when compare screenshots are visually acceptable AND `compare.json` `pass: true` (or user explicitly accepts known gaps in `RESEARCH.md`).

**Build rule (remix):** Ship when your product meets the **Creative direction** in `RESEARCH.md` — not when pixels match the reference.

## Build workflow (when requested — mirror or remix)

1. Confirm mode in `RESEARCH.md` (`mirror` or `remix`)
2. Read `DESIGN.md` + all screenshots
3. **Mirror:** match layout, chrome, motion to reference. **Remix:** match **language** only — use **Substitutions** table
4. Use **fixed rhythm tokens**; let section height vary naturally
5. Build section-by-section
6. Motion via CSS/GSAP snippets (Step 3c)
7. **Icons & emoji:** CDP-check each slot. Use emoji **only** when reference `innerHTML` contains emoji
8. **Mirror only:** Step 7 compare gates — fix until pass
9. **Remix:** optional compare for QA; dev-server screenshot vs your design intent

Default stack: **Next.js + Tailwind**, Google Fonts when identified.

## Fidelity expectations

| Site type | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Typography-heavy / Framer landing | 80–90% |
| Hand-coded React/Tailwind | 90–95% |
| Heavy 3D / WebGL hero | 60–75% without hero substitute |

## Rules

- **No user screenshot → agent browser screenshot** (non-negotiable)
- **Research before code** unless user explicitly skips
- **Screenshots are ground truth**
- **Never** commit scraped proprietary assets as your own
- **Overwrite guard:** ask before overwriting existing `docs/research/{slug}/`
